        <p class="e-content">
          The authors of this text go into depth about what makes up the
          World-Wide Web (W3). We have covered the basics of what a URL is or
          what the HTTP is. I will not go into what those do but how those
          connect people from opposite sides of the world and encourage
          collaboration and learning.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          In the opening paragraph it mentions that the W3 has succeeded in
          becoming a large library of knowledge however, it has surpassed that
          and has now become a “sea of knowledge” [1]. The ocean covers a large
          amount of the earth, and we don’t even know everything about it.
          Majority of it has not even been explored so calling it an ocean of
          knowledge is fair as we cannot possibly read and obtain every bit of
          knowledge that is on the internet. This just shows how big the
          internet had become in 1994. Trying to imagine how big it has gotten
          in the next 28 years is somewhat impossible. What is amazing is the
          fact that we have access to all this knowledge just from a computer
          and a browser. [1]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          We are sharing and expanding on the knowledge as well as collaborating
          by writing these critical analyses. A more relatable example of
          collaborating through the internet would be with GitHub. Assume we
          were in a group making a website. GitHub allows us to upload code to a
          remote repository so that we would be able to collaborate without
          having to use a USB stick with all the scripts for example. With a USB
          stick you would have to wait for the other person to finish editing a
          script before you can continue with it. GitHub allows us to
          collaborate at the same time. This increases efficiency and makes
          sharing code much easier.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          An example which I find interesting is with supercomputers and quantum
          computers. Researchers from around the world can gain access to a
          computer with high processing power from the other side of the world.
          Allowing people to connect to it through the internet they have
          encouraged collaboration and could add to the sea of knowledge for
          other people to then collaborate on.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          Quantum computers are still far away from being in a home for someone
          to use but people are now able to write code for a quantum computer
          and play games on one from across the world. I will leave these two
          links in the citations below if anyone is interested in looking at it.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          It truly is amazing how far the W3 has come. We can collaborate and
          add to a sea of knowledge all because of a URL, HTTP, HTML, and
          servers. [1] This is the reason the entire world is connected. Just
          imagine where we would be without the internet. It would be difficult
          to collaborate and help each other right now without it.
