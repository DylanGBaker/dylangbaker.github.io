            Close Reading of Graham et al’s “Toward a study 
            of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and 
            a mapping of the geographies of information”
          </h1>
        </header>
  
        <p class="e-content">
          Information in terms of books, newspaper or digital information has geography. 
          It is written or produced somewhere, it could be about somewhere – such as a wiki page on South Africa – 
          and it is iterated and changed somewhere in the world. The geography of the information is what 
          determines the information and how it is produced. [1]
        </p>
  
        <p class="e-content">Obviously before we had computers and the internet information was done on paper mainly such as books and newspapers but that comes from people who have the funds to do so. This led to power and control over media. It was also hard to get a book or newspaper from a different continent without the internet. This can cause the information to be specific to a certain country or continent and so is geographically specific. This causes geographic information to be uneven and tends toward information being distributed by certain countries more than others. [1]</p>
  
        <p class="e-content">Considering we now have the internet one would think that it is easier to gain access and contribute to digital information. Graham et al’s states, “some cases are being amplified rather than alleviated.” [1] Although the internet is global this reading will show us that majority of the contributors to information today is still mainly the global north. This close reading will summarize and reflect on Graham et al’s study of information geographies and how it can be seen today in the global south. [1]</p>
  
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Geographies of access and enablement</h2>
        </header>
  
        <p class="e-content">The internet is a large space and full of information for people to gain access to. Only issue is that people need to be aware that the information exists on the internet, and they need access to that through a connection. This costs money. According to Graham et al’s paper North Americans, South Americans, and Europeans only need to pay about 10% of their income for a connection to the internet (based on average income). Compared to Eritrea where an average worker would have to work for 50 years to get a connection to the internet for just one year. [1]</p>
  
        <p class="e-content">Most of the global North has relatively cheap prices for a connection compared the global south. Even though people can now participate and contribute to the information on the internet, gaining access is still an issue in most of the global south. Figure 1 in Graham et al’s paper represents the uneven access. Even countries where it is relatively cheap compared to the global south still had to progression. Such as India, where it could cost about $6 for access to the internet. Cheap access yet they still had a lower percentage of people accessing the internet compared to other countries. This shows the uneven geography of information and how America and Europe still had control of the production and collaboration of information on the internet even though the world had access to do so as well. [1]</p>
  
        <p class="e-content">Not only do people need to get access but they need a device to allow them to do so. A lot of people in Africa live in poverty and are trying to make it day by day and so getting internet access and a device to access the internet is the least of their worries. This further emphasizes that even though we now have access to information no matter where you are the distribution and collaboration of geographical information is still uneven.  </p>
  
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Geographies of participation</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">People might have access to information on the internet but how many people participate in distributing and collaborating on the information on the internet? Graham et al uses data from domain names, GitHub commits, and Wikipedia edits. The data is taken based off a country’s contribution to these variables.</p>
        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>Domain names:</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">Domain names are used as to represent the location of digital information. For example, www.example.uk or www.example.us are Top-Level Domains and used for country specific websites. [1]</p>
        <p class="e-content">These are a helpful indication of a country’s contribution to information on the internet as it is region specific. Graham et al states, “domain names remain in high demand by business, civil society organizations and individuals from around the world seeking to make their material findable.” For people wanting to make their information globally known they would want the world to find it. This would directly indicate how much a country is participating in adding to the sea of knowledge on the internet. This is assuming there are not restrictions on internet usage in a country. From Figure 3 in the paper, it can still be seen that there is an uneven distribution of geographic information as majority of Top-Level Domains are from North America and Europe. [1] </p>
        <p class="e-content">As mentioned, Africa has a high poverty rate, and thus not many people can afford the technology to make domain names and contribute to the information on the internet. Hence, there will be a low percentage of domain names in Africa and an uneven distribution of geographic information.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>GitHub Collaboration:</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">With the times that we live in now learning how to use a computer and learning to code are useful skills to obtain. Especially with what people want to do with software now and how fast it is developing and changing. GitHub allows people to collaborate with code which is the backbone of the internet. Without code we would not have made information more accessible than before. Again, from the data in the paper it is seen that North America and Europe consist of the most users and percentage of commits to all the commits on GitHub. Therefore, again showing the uneven distribution of geographic information. [1] Let’s consider GitHub commits. To write code, you need a laptop.  Laptops that are not high spec are still quite expensive in South Africa. Even if people wanted to help and contribute to the vast ocean of information, they might not be able to due to financial struggles. This will then result in a low percentage of users compared to other places and hence a low percentage of commits to GitHub.</p>
        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>Wikipedia Contributions:</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">Wikipedia allows people to contribute and collaborate on information. People can learn about a certain country and its history on Wikipedia, yet majority of the southern hemisphere’s countries Wikipedia’s are not written by the country itself. “The percentages in Africa are much lower. Only 16% of Nigerian content and 9% of Kenyan content is created by locals and in much of the rest of the continent less than 5% of content is generated locally.” [1]</p>
        <p class="e-content">From the data in the paper, the global north is still producing majority of the content and Wikipedia edits. Again, showing the uneven distribution of geographic information. [1]</p>
  
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Geographies of representation</h2>
        </header>
  
        <p class="e-content">Geographies of representation is used to see what parts of the world information is created and what parts are not. Graham et al used Google search engine, OpenStreetMap, and the semantic web to for the data of this section. [1]</p>
  
        <p class="e-content">Google search engine gives an estimation as to how many results they could find for what you search. This can show you how much info there is for a country. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is open source meaning that many people can contribute to the mapping of roads in a country. All the data for the representation again shows how the global north like North America and Europe are the main contributors to the representation of the geographical information. [1] </p>
  
        <p class="e-content">Although the information is accessible people need to have a connection to the internet and that might just not be viable for some countries due to do high rates of poverty. </p>
  
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">We now have the internet, and this makes information more accessible. However, it does not mean that more people will participate in the contribution and collaboration. If anything, it has made it easier for countries that were al ready participating in the sharing of information. It has also made it easier for countries mainly in the southern hemisphere to start contributing but because of being left behind originally it is still hard due to costs and how many people have accessibility.</p>
        <p class="e-content">Majority of people have a phone which can gain access to internet but again due to financial difficulties some people might need to use the data that they have for work and not have extra to go on the internet. They could go find a place that supplies free Wi-Fi however, it is not the safest option, and someone could get their information stolen and abused for malicious intent.</p>
        <p class="e-content">Africa is trying to catch up, but it is difficult due to poverty and how accessible technology is. Africa has come far since this Graham et al paper was written. Prices for data are cheaper, we have fiber optics now, and bigger industries are putting servers in Africa to make accessing things on the internet easier. I hope that as time goes on, Africa will have better access to the internet and hopefully we start making more contributions to the internet (especially on the technology side like GitHub) so that we make an impact on the geographic information of our world.</p>
