        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>What is Metadata?</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          Metadata when searched shows data used to describe information about
          other data. This is vague however a useful definition as there are
          many different types of metadata. [1] A basic example of metadata is
          for a book. There is the publisher, the author, date of publication
          and name of the book. The data will be the words that are in the book
          that tell the story.
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Why use Metadata?</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          Metadata makes it easier to find certain data. Using the above
          example, we can use the name of the author and the name of the book to
          find it in a library or on the internet if it was published on the
          internet. This is descriptive metadata. It describes different
          characteristics of the data. Another example is when a photo is taken
          with your phone. When taken your phone for can store the location it
          was taken, what day it was taken, and the time it was taken. [2]
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          Other types of metadata include structural metadata, process metadata,
          reference metadata, and statistical metadata. All these metadata’s
          help describe information about other data so that the data can be
          easily accessed. [2] So, what metadata can be used in html scripts to
          help with accessing our websites?
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>How do we use Metadata in HTML?</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          The metadata used in html scripts allows the web browser to obtain a
          description of the webpage. This helps the browser understand what is
          contained in the webpage from the character set, cookies, and
          keywords. [2]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The most important thing when you have a website is to get users of
          the internet to click on your website. To do so you need to tell the
          search engine to try and recommend your webpage according to the
          keywords that the user has entered in the search engine. [2]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          This is done with meta data in the html scripts. This would be done by
          using the &lt;meta&gt; tag. It will look something like this
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          &lt;meta name=“keywords” content=“metadata, meta tags, what is meta
          data” /&gt; [2]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          This allows the search engine to possibly suggest your website when
          these keywords are entered into the search bar in the web browser. [3]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          When people do research or want to find something out about a certain
          topic one of the most important aspects is when that research was
          written or when it was last updated and revised. Metadata allows you
          to revise the date you last edited a webpage as that would be
          descriptive metadata. [3]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          Something that often occurs when users are on a website is redirecting
          to different pages. Let’s say you want the redirect to take some time
          and not be instant. You can use a &lt;meta&gt; tag to ensure that
          there is a bit of time between the users input and the redirect. [3]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          Other examples include cookies which are practically on every website
          a user visits. You can then determine whether you want the cookie
          settings to be deleted after the user leaves the browser or after a
          certain amount of time. The character set is also an important piece
          of metadata as it allows the browser to encode and decode what
          characters are being used for the webpage. [3]
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The number of metadata that can be used is not endless but is vast.
          There are also many more types of metadata, but it all helps in
          finding and analysing other data much easier for a user.
