          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          “Anime.js (/ˈæn.ə.meɪ/) is a lightweight JavaScript animation library
          with a simple, yet powerful API. It works with CSS properties, SVG,
          DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects. [1]”
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I felt that my site was quite static. It was lacking possible movement
          and animations. Looking online I found that you can do animations
          through CSS and JavaScript, but it can get complex, and the code can
          get long. I thought I would try and find an external JavaScript
          library that I could use to make animation code simple but that can do
          a lot. By doing it through JavaScript I could also use one JavaScript
          to handle all my animations instead of writing it for every CSS
          element that needs it.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          There were other options such as Bounce.js or Velocity.js but from the
          research most of the suggestions were that Anime.js is good and easy
          to use. From my time using it I agree.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          From the examples they give in their documentation to how to implement
          it in your code it was all done in a way too make it as simple as
          possible but allow someone to make it complex if that’s the animations
          that they want, and it can get very complicated.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>How did help?</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          As I mentioned above, I felt that my site was static and needed some
          movement to make the user experience better. However, I did not want
          to make everything dynamic as that could become too much movement and
          make the user experience worse.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I just started with the question is what is simple yet effective. My
          first thought for introducing some movement is when the user first
          loads a page. I wanted my logo and navbar links to have an animation
          where it gets bigger and maybe slides into place.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The logo starts with a smaller scale and then simply moves into its
          position over time and goes back to its normal scale. It was hard to
          find what duration the animation should take place over so that it was
          not too fast or too slow. This took quite a bit of time, but the API
          made it easy to test.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I feel that although these animations are simple, they provide some
          movement and excitement when looking at my website. Just looking at a
          static website the whole time can be monotonous and so by adding these
          simple animations it made my website more interesting and a little
          more exciting to look at for the user.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          Another way I could have added movement was through Vanta.js however
          this for animated backgrounds and I really wanted my background to be
          a piece of me (which is currently my pc setup) so I decided against
          it.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>What did not work?</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          For now, my site only uses animations for that. I tried implementing
          the same animations for the smaller viewports like for tablet and
          smartphone. The logo worked but due to the click event for the navbar
          it was causing bugs if the user opens and closes the navbar too
          quickly. The bug would be fixed if the user refreshes the page.
          Instead of hoping that people don’t open and close it quickly or want
          to constantly refresh the page I decided to not implement it on the
          navbar but I kept the animation on the logo so there is still some
          dynamic movement but not exactly what I want.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I wanted to add a little wiggle to other links on the page when a
          person hovers over it however I could not figure out how to give it
          the little wiggle and I was not too sure if that would be too much for
          the user. It might be quite unsettling and too much for some users if
          every link that you hover over wiggles. I would like to test it out in
          future though.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          The API is easy to implement, and their documentation gives examples
          and tells you what is possible with all the functions that you can
          implement with the API. I would recommend this for anyone wanting to
          make their animations easier and allow an API to do the heavy lifting.
