          When I started on the website, I was excited to learn new languages
          especially since these are most likely used in everyday life, and I
          use the internet every day. Since developing my own website I have a
          newfound respect for people who do this everyday as there as so many
          decisions and design choices that need to be made. Then implementing
          the design and bringing it to life is another problem to solve.
        </p>

          <h2>Code Design</h2>

        <p class="e-content">
          I am used to coding in languages that are object orientated languages
          such as C++ and C#. When I started working on HTML and CSS, I tried to
          use similar concepts to try and make my codes design better and so
          that other developers find it easier to read. I felt that I have
          achieved that however, right now I feel that it can change in some
          areas especially with some of my variable names and in my CSS.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          One area that has improved drastically is the navbar.js. Previously
          there was a JavaScript file for each webpage’s navbar to control the
          linking between pages. I managed to get it down to just one JavaScript
          file to control it for all pages. It is probably not perfect since if
          you add other pages it could break on those pages but for now it works
          and it is in one file.
        </p>

          <h2>Webpage Design</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          Overall, I am happy with the way that I have laid out my website but
          there were issues with certain things. The footer was implemented
          correctly and that’s when I learnt that you could use CSS to calculate
          heights. I thought everything had to be done manually. But to make it
          responsive you can calculate the height with implicit values like
          height: calc (100vh – 20rem-8%). Very useful and I will do my best not
          to forget that.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I am a person that really enjoys and believes in the iterative design
          process. But in that process, I get the main choices and ideas out
          first before I start to make it pretty. I would rather have something
          that is usable and lacks some CSS than have a lot of CSS to make it
          look nice but then nothing works. For now, I have not deemed the about
          me section that important yet or the contact section. I am mainly
          focusing on the home page, as that is what people normally see first,
          and the blog section. I am still currently testing stuff on the home
          page and so if the wireframe is not the same that is why. It will
          however be very similar.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I initially had decent responsiveness with certain elements on my
          webpages but it was not great and so I had to add media queries for
          multiple and inconsistent pixel values. Like at 1500px the styling
          would work and then suddenly at 1450px it was broken again. This was
          until I released that percentage values are better for margins or
          sizes compared to “rem” or “em”. Once I started using percentages for
          my styling of margins the number of media queries decreased and this
          also made my code design better and more readable.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          My background image is still a bit weird on mobile devices and
          possibly tablets but im not too sure how to fix it. I tried to make
          the image smaller, but it still did not work. It might just be that I
          did not make the image small enough.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          My webpage has a lot of images on the design page and portfolio page
          as well as gifs being on the portfolio page. This is when I learned
          the importance of optimizing gifs and images. Using the network tab in
          the inspector allowed me to see the load times of images and gifs. By
          compressing and optimizing images and gifs I was able to decrease the
          loading time from about 290ms to 4ms or so. The network tab is a very
          useful tool, and I will forever understand its importance for future
          development on websites if I do develop on websites.

          With the implementation of Anime.js animations were made easier, but I
          wish I had figured out more creative animations to add to my page to
          make it more interesting. It is definitely better than having no
          animations, but I wish I had been more creative with it.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          Throughout the process of designing and implementing this website it
          has been very enjoyable to sit down and work on placement of elements
          and seeing what works best in my mind at that time but, it has had its
          downs. I am not the best at art and so picking the correct colour for
          elements has been a trouble for me. But that’s why I enjoy the
          iterative design process as I can then ask for opinions and then
          rework stuff.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          There is still a lot to optimize with my code and new stuff that I
          would like to try as well as add more stuff for responsiveness and to
          make the pages look like what my mind is seeing and imagining. But I
          am getting there as well as growing as a developer and designer. This
          is one of the projects I have enjoyed the most.
