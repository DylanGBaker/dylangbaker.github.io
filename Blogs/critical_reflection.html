          When I started on the website, I was excited to learn new languages
          especially since these are most likely used in everyday life, and I
          use the internet every day. Since developing my own website I have a
          newfound respect for people who do this everyday as there as so many
          decisions and design choices that need to be made. Then implementing
          the design and bringing it to life is another problem to solve.
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Code Design</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          I am used to coding in languages that are object orientated languages
          such as C++ and C#. When I started working on HTML and CSS, I tried to
          use similar concepts to try and make my codes design better and so
          that other developers find it easier to read. I felt that I have
          achieved that however, right now I feel that it can change in some
          areas especially with some of my variable names and in my CSS.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Webpage Design</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          I like the way that I have structured my webpages but there are some
          issues. The first issue that I am trying to figure out is the footer.
          I know you can add the copyright and your name but even when I add
          that some of the elements on my page still go to the bottom and I am
          trying to figure out how to get it to stop doing that. I feel that
          there is an issue with my CSS somewhere and I am debugging it.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The font is something that I am still unsure about as I kind of like
          it but at the same time while developing the website and seeing the
          font a lot I would like to change it but before I do, I would like to
          get more input from other people.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I am a person that really enjoys and believes in the iterative design
          process. But in that process, I get the main choices and ideas out
          first before I start to make it pretty. I would rather have something
          that is usable and lacks some CSS than have a lot of CSS to make it
          look nice but then nothing works. For now, I have not deemed the about
          me section that important yet or the contact section. I am mainly
          focusing on the home page, as that is what people normally see first,
          and the blog section. I am still currently testing stuff on the home
          page and so if the wireframe is not the same that is why.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          Throughout the process of designing and implementing this website has
          been very enjoyable to sit down and work on placement of elements and
          seeing what works best in my mind at that time but, it definitely has
          had its downs. I am not the best at art and so picking the correct
          colour for elements has been a trouble for me. But thatâ€™s why I enjoy
          the iterative design process as I can then ask for opinions and then
          rework stuff.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          There is still a lot to optimize with my code and new stuff that I
          would like to try as well as add more stuff for responsiveness and to
          make the pages look like what my mind is seeing and imagining. But I
          am getting there as well as growing as a developer and designer. This
          is definitely one of the projects I have enjoyed the most. So far at
          least.
