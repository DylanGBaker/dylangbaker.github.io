          <h1 class="p-name">What is a URL and how do they work?</h1>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a string used for addresses of
          resources on the internet such as documents or images (objects). It
          acts the same as an address when trying to find a location. An address
          for a house will have info like the house number, the street, and the
          city for example. To find an object on the internet it also has an
          address to locate it. It does not consist of a house number or the
          city the server is in, but it does have its own protocol which will be
          discussed in this text. [1] [3]
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          A URL can be considered a web address but what makes up the address?
          It is made up of the scheme, domain name, port (optional), path to the
          file, parameters, and the anchor (optional). [1]
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>The Scheme</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          This is the protocol that the user’s browser uses to get the resource
          and allows the transfer of data between computers and servers on the
          internet. The one that majority of people are familiar with is HTTP or
          HTTPS. The ‘S’ shows that the protocol is secure and is encrypted in
          some way to protect the data that is being transferred. These are not
          the only protocols. There are other protocols such as ‘mailto’ or
          ‘NNTP.’ A protocol can be made for different objects on the internet.
          [1] For example, ‘NNTP’ is the protocol that can be used for news
          articles. [3]
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Domain Name and Port</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          The domain name shows the protocol which web server to find and
          request the resource from. We typically do not add the port number as
          the protocol knows which port the URL is using. The port is like the
          gate to a house. It allows the port on your computer to communicate
          with the servers’ port by allowing data to transfer between the
          “gates.” [1]
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Path to the File</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          The path to the resource that the user is looking for on the web
          server. This is when a user goes to the home page of a web page and
          then looks at a different section such as the shoe collection in a
          store. If the user then decides to click on a shoe and look more into
          it, it will take the user to a different path to show the resources on
          that path on the web server. [1]
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Parameters</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          These are just extra words that the web server is given in the case
          that the web server must do other stuff before sending the resource
          back to the user. This depends on the web server owner as not all web
          servers will use extra parameters before sending the resource back.
          The parameters are key-value pairs which is important for data
          structures such as maps in computer science. Although complicated it
          is interesting to see its applications in algorithms. [1]
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Anchor</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          The anchor is not necessary but can be a part of the URL. It acts as a
          bookmark and helps the browser go to the bookmark when showing the
          resource to the user. It is not sent to the server as a request but
          used by the browser. Almost like sending a video to someone with a
          time stamp or when you research something and you click on the first
          link, it might take you to the part of the resource relevant to what
          you searched.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          There are different types of URLs but the ones we are probably
          familiar with are the absolute and relative URLs. An absolute URL has
          everything from the above that the web needs to find the resource. A
          relative URL does not contain everything that the web needs. It most
          commonly shortens the path of the URL. [1] [2] For example:
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          Absolute URL: https://www.pandas.org/docs/learn/environment/food
          (Pretty sure this does not exist so if you try it, and it does it is a
          coincidence)
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">Relative URL: https://www.pandas.org/docs/food</p>

        <p class="e-content">
          So, what are URLs and how do they work? They are addresses that have a
          protocol and that allows the browser to search for the address and
          allow a user access to what is stored at that address provided it
          exists.
