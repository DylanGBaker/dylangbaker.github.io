          A large part of modern society pretty much lives on the internet. And
          when you have a lot of people using something there is bound to be a
          large diversity in that society. You would think that logically all
          you have to do is design something accessible for all the different
          types of people that exist out there because people want to help
          people and be ethical in doing so, right? Unfortunately, that’s not
          always the case.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          Of course, there are people out there that design to be accessible to
          everyone that uses that product and mistakes are bound to happen as
          not everybody is perfect. The issues arise when there is a lack of
          responsibility taken as well as poor design choices and mentality.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>Design Injustice</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          Let’s start by looking at an example of design injustice. Some
          airports have a machine called a millimeter wave scanner which checks
          to see if an individual may be carrying something on them that is
          illegal. The machine uses gender to determine the outcome and the
          issue is that it only has the choice of male or female. This becomes a
          problem for people who don’t identify as either of those. This then
          causes problems with the airport security and just causes an unwanted
          amount of stress and issues that can just be avoided through
          accessible design. [1]
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          You would think ok then, let’s just update the software and then we
          are good to go. Sure, that does help in the future, but it does not
          address the issue as to why this problem occurred and how it can be
          prevented in the future. That’s the point of mistakes, to learn from
          them and then prevent it from happening in the future. When making
          software people should try and stick to the ACM code of ethics as
          closely as possible. The designers of the millimeter wave scanner
          failed in a couple areas of ethics such as “avoid harm” as well as “be
          fair and take action not to discriminate” to name a few [4].
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>
            So, what can be done to prevent these mistakes from happening?
          </h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          In <i>“Algorithmic Injustices: Towards a Relational Ethics”</i> , it
          mentions that people who are not thought of in the design of stuff
          that society uses are often the ones most affected [2]. Take the
          millimeter wave scanner for example. For Sasha Costanza-Chock this was
          design injustice as the machine determined that they were a risk. This
          causes a security protocol to then take place which is also
          cis-normative and binary and therefore another process is not
          accessible to others who are not male or female [1].
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          to others who are not male or female [1]. The machines software
          ultimately showed the injustice as the different security systems in
          place were only accessible to male or female and not inclusive of
          people who identify differently.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          We ultimately need to design with not just the majority in mind but
          all people that our software could affect. Using the machine as an
          example again, it deals with people. So, when designing those systems,
          you need to think of any possible situation that could arise with
          people’s genders. Since there are a lot of people on this earth the
          system was bound to see a transgendered person, yet the software did
          not have an option for that. I feel like the company who made the
          machine can implement different gender options yet there was not, and
          I feel like that was just ignorance on their part and maybe just
          assumed that the airport security can deal with it. So, in my eyes we
          need to stray away from these thought patterns that if the problem
          arises then we can just quickly fix it and then continue on without
          thinking of the repercussions.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          So how do we prevent this? We need to stop thinking of just the
          majority of software and internet users. In our design choices we need
          to ask ourselves hard questions that could even make us uncomfortable
          as we may not know the answers to those questions at that moment
          however, by asking those questions we start reducing the injustice in
          our designs. Of course, this then needs to be shared and spoken about
          on the internet itself so that awareness is created.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          We need to stop thinking that just because it is software it is an
          accident and therefore not finding the root cause of the issues.
          Nobody is perfect though and mistakes will most likely be made but by
          changing our way of thinking in terms of our design then we start to
          mitigate the mistakes and learning from them rather than just saying
          sorry and making a quick software fix. By doing this, developers
          should be sticking to the ACM code of ethics more closely and hence we
          will have better software.
