          <h1 class="p-name">Analysis of my Websites UX and UI Design</h1>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          The UI and UX concepts I used for my website were found in a lecture
          that was given by Peta Goldberg. User Experience (UX) is what allows a
          person to perform actions on an interface. User Interface (UI) is what
          gives the interface an aesthetic and creates an emotional connection
          with the user. [1]
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          Why is this important? The reason we make a website is for a user to
          traverse through it and experience the content that is on the website.
          Without UX and UI people probably will not interact with your website.
          As mentioned, the UI creates an emotional connection with the user. If
          the UI is designed poorly the user may establish a bad emotional
          connection with the website and hence, they probably will not come
          back to the website. As a designer and developer, you want people to
          come back and possibly even share it with people that they know. So UX
          and UI design is important. [1]
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>What could be better or is a bad idea?</h2>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          I’m going to start with what could be better or what was a bad design
          choice. I prefer to end on a good note.
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>Design Section:</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          In the design section I embedded a pdf for the style guide and
          wireframes. I had seen this used on other websites, but it was
          probably also because I was lazy to do the CSS and HTML for this
          section. So, I just assumed that it was a standard thing to do on a
          website. It also made sense to me to have that stuff in a pdf.
          However, from feedback and looking at it again it does work but it
          seems quite disconnected from my websites experience. My website uses
          dark colours. The embedded pdf is white and the page numbers at the
          top have a different font. This does feel weird and sort of creates a
          disconnect from what I have put on the page and the style that I am
          going for. It creates a negative emotional connection which is what I
          don’t want. I will reimplement this using HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>Responsiveness:</h3>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content"></p>
        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>About me section:</h3>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          Due to time constraints the about me section is not very interesting.
          It needs more work and more styling just so that it does not feel as
          if it is completely different to everything else and therefore
          creating a negative emotional response. The same goes for the contact
          me section.
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_subheaders">
          <h3>General Stuff:</h3>
        </header>

        <p class="e-content">
          I don’t have a footer or header and the text of blog posts for example
          are quite close to the top and the bottom which makes navigating and
          reading the blog posts difficult near the top and the bottom.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          The blog posts make up a large chunk of the content on the website and
          so people will spend a large amount of time there. I would like to
          make this area the most comfortable because of that.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          The fonts I chose were based off the lectures which shows that in
          general serif fonts are good to use for readability [1]. However, the
          font that I chose although it is serif, could probably be better in
          terms of readability. It does work but I do think I could choose a
          different style of serif font for the fonts that are not headings. The
          headings are using san serif. For now, it is working but it has been
          suggested to try and make them both serifs. I am using iterative
          design to make my website so I will try with both using serif and vice
          versa to see which one people prefer.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          The blog section opens a new tab when you click on a blog post.
          Although this is the way that I prefer to view things on the web it is
          not the standard. If it’s the same site, then it’s better to just
          redirect the user to the blog post rather than opening it up in a new
          tab.
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          Feedback is also important with user interfaces. I would like to add
          some feedback on tabs like when someone is on blog post 1 then that
          button or link is highlighted.
        </p>

        <header class="paragraph_headers">
          <h2>What is working?</h2>
        </header>
        <p class="e-content">
          I’ll start with the home page. I tried to make use of a law called the
          Hick’s Law and I used a call to action (CTA). Hick’s Law states that,
          “The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number of
          complexity choices [1].” I implemented this with the different
          sections that you can go to on my website. I did not add more than
          what I needed and so people don’t feel overwhelmed with the choices
          they have.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The CTA I used to try and interest a user in finding out more about
          me. I would like to add more for the blog posts and the portfolio
          pieces.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The home page also made use of the Law of Locality [1]. These are as
          follows:
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          • Law 1: “Put an element where it will effect change [1].”
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          • Law 2: “If an element effects change across the entire area, put it
          above the area [1].”
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          • Law 3: “If an element is far from where it effects change, make it
          pop [1].”
        </p>

        <p class="e-content">
          I used these laws for the redirect links in the nav bar. They affect
          the entire area of the website when clicked on and so put it right at
          the top of the website. I was originally going to put these links
          along the left side of the page but with the number of links and with
          a 1080p screen it seemed underwhelming and empty and so spreading them
          across the top made the nav bar feel fuller and appeared to be better
          due to the law of locality [1].
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          The blog section shows a snippet of the blog. The idea behind this was
          by using the Zeigarnik Effect. The Zeigarnik Effect is as follows,
          “People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than
          completed tasks [1].” I was trying to pique interest in the user to
          read the blogs by only giving some of the blog post.
        </p>
        <p class="e-content">
          I wanted my site to be friendly and not formal or business like. To
          give that feeling I chose a background picture that is formal. All the
          text or buttons with a coloured background are rounded. This creates a
          more friendly visual to the site which is what I wanted. [1]
